# Trajectory Studio

**Trajectory Studio** is an interactive, web-based dashboard and 3D WebGL viewport designed for inspecting, planning, and validating 6DOF industrial robot arm trajectories. It allows robot engineers to load trajectory profiles, inspect joint kinematic curves, visualize motion in 3D, and detect position/velocity limit violations in real-time.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive 3D WebGL Viewport
- **Visual Robot Mesh**: Renders robot links and axis joints dynamically using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters.
- **Dashed Joint-Limit Rings**: Visual circles appear around joint caps when joints approach their limits:
  - **Approach Warning**: A thin dashed red circle appears when a joint gets within $20^\circ$ (0.35 rad) or $15\%$ of its range limits, or when joint velocity exceeds $75\%$ of its speed limit.
  - **Critical Approach**: Two concentric dashed red circles appear when getting closer than 5% of limits.
  - **Limit Violation**: Three concentric dashed red circles appear (simulating a thick red line) if limits are exceeded.
- **TCP Path & Target Marker**: Highlights the Tool Center Point (TCP) path trajectory with a glowing cyan tube and tracks the active position with a cyan sphere marker.
- **X (Red) & Y (Green) Coordinate Guides**: Renders physical axis paths at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$.

### 2. Kinematics Charting (Chart.js)
- Renders curves for **Position**, **Velocity**, **Acceleration**, and **Jerk** over time.
- Samples every knot on both sides plus a dense grid, so short (7 ms) edge segments are never skipped. Jerk is constant per cubic segment and is drawn as exact steps between knots.
- **Acceleration steps**: where the left and right acceleration limits at a knot, part junction, or rest start/stop differ by more than 1e-3 rad/s², the Accel chart marks the jump and the Jerk chart draws an impulse arrow, each labelled with the time, joint, and step size.
- The joint count comes from the trajectory data (5-DOF arms such as the Doosan P3020 work).
- **Vertical Cursor**: Tracks the active playback position with a dashed cyan line.
- **Joint-Colored Limit Lines**: If any joint gets within 5% of its position or velocity limit, a dashed horizontal line is drawn on the graph using that joint's color (Purple for J1, Blue for J2, etc.) along with a clear label.
- **Exceeded States**: Exceeding a limit draws a thick, solid red line (`3.0px`) with an `EXCEEDED!` label. The chart's Y-axis auto-expands (adding 8% padding) to guarantee limit lines are fully visible.

### 3. Integrated Timeline & Playback
- Consolidates play/pause, loop, speed factor (0.25x to 2x), and current/total time display labels inside a unified controls row aligned under the chart.
- A custom-aligned HTML timeline slider sits directly on top of the chart's bottom boundary line, mapping perfectly to 0% and 100% of the active curve bounds.

### 4. Interactive Kinematic State Table
- Displays active values for Joint, Position (rad), Velocity (rad/s), and Accel (rad/s²).
- Features visual progress tracks displaying the current joint position/speed centered between its negative and positive limit markers. Exceeding limits highlights values in glowing red.

### 5. Geometric Spline Recalculation
- **Path Editing**: Users can graphically manipulate the 3D trajectory geometry using interactive drag-and-drop handles directly in the scene viewport.
- **Kinematic Re-Planning**: A Python backend leverages an Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver (BFGS optimization) to calculate accurate continuous joint configurations for the modified path. It automatically locks and preserves the initial orientation (e.g., wrist-down) throughout the entire trajectory.
- **Dynamic Time Scaling & Limits**: Uses Scipy's `CubicSpline` algorithm to re-parameterize the trajectory in time. It calculates safe velocity profiles that strictly obey user-configurable TCP Speed and Centripetal Force constraints, preventing dynamic torque violations.

## Installation & How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Running the Application
1. Clone or copy the repository files to a local folder.
2. Open a terminal inside the project root directory and run the web server:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```text
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
4. Selecting any trajectory from the left sidebar will render the 3D robot, compute its forward kinematics, populate motion charts, and display limits validation.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Logic**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules, OrbitControls).
- **3D Engine**: Three.js (WebGL renderer).
- **Charting**: Chart.js (custom layout and annotations plugins).
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (CSS Variables, Flexbox, absolute layouts, backdrop-filters).
- **Backend Utility**: Python (HTTP serving, file system monitoring, spline scaling computations).

## Barilla historical collection

The `barilla` branch preserves the September 9–10, 2026 Studio improvements and
all 135 historical Barilla requests and results. Open `corpus.html` for the
sortable task table. The earlier review report remains intentionally removed,
matching the original session request.

The tracked `Trajectories/traj` files, `trajectories.json`, and
`palletize_corpus.json` form one complete collection. Earlier bundled samples
remain in the parent commit. New replay collections under `collections/` and
local IDE settings are excluded from this snapshot.

## Live OmniPack test viewer

Bundled trajectories have been removed. Run `python live.py --trajectories
/home/USER/Omni/robot/OmniPack/Trajectories --metrics /path/to/test/metrics.json`
(on one line), or use Telegram `/traj test-start`. The live server binds localhost
port 8000 and reads the flat `.traj`/`.repr` settings directory on every refresh.
Writes to live settings are disabled. Compute is elapsed submission-to-result time
including queue; travel sums part knot spans. Both metrics can be sorted using the
sidebar buttons. A missing computation metric is shown as unknown.
